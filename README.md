# Python Developer Challenge

### 1. We need you to implement a variation of Javascript’s parseInt() function to handle hexadecimal numbers. Let’s call it parseHexInt(), where:
- parseHexInt(“A”) == 10
- parseHexInt(“1F”) == 31
- parseHexInt(“0”) == 0 

Note: you have to implement the code that converts a string in int. You cannot use parseInt nor int(text, 16). Input will always be valid (e.g. non-empty strings containing chars from 0 to 9 and from A to F) non-negative numbers.

### 2. Given a list of integers, find two numbers whose sum is the largest among all possible sums.
#### Example:
```
[1, 10, 3, 7, 9] => 10 + 9 = 19
[-2, 1, -1, 0] => 1 + 0 => 1
```
Note: input will always have at least two items. Your algorithm can scan the input only once. Hint:
you should not sort it.

### 3. BONUS: Please implement sqrt() using only loops, ifs, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 
#### Example:
```
sqrt(9.0) = 3.0
sqrt(2.0) = 1.4142
```
Hint: This can be modeled as a search problem and the solution is between the input number and
1.0.

### 4. Why JSON is better than XML?

### 5. Please tell me about the most important/interesing project you worked on. Why was it important? Which programming language you used? Why you believe you were vital for it?
